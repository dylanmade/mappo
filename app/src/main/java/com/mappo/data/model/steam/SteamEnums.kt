 * **Naming convention.** Steam Input modes are named `<input> <output>` — left word
 * = input feel, right word = output format. So `JOYSTICK_MOUSE` means a joystick
 * input that outputs as mouse motion; `JOYSTICK_MOVE` means a joystick input that
 * outputs as XInput axis (the game receives a stick); `MOUSE_REGION` is the
 * trackpad-style absolute-region mapping. See [feedback_steam_mode_naming_convention.md].
 *
 * **DEVICE_DEFAULT vs NONE.** Two distinct no-output sentinels:
 *  - [DEVICE_DEFAULT] — Mappo does NOT intercept; Android's hardware-native input
 *    flows untouched to the foreground app. Mappo-specific concept.
 *  - [NONE] — Mappo intercepts and silences. Direct Steam Input parity.
