 * FC1 forward-compat seam (single-screen refactor, Brick 2): tabs are exposed as
 * opaque descriptors — id + display label — rather than [com.mappo.data.model.GridLayout]
 * rows. Today's resolver maps `layoutId → GridLayout` through `KeyLayoutRepository`;
 * post-parity, when overlays are governed by `ActionSet` / `ActionLayer` instead of
 * a single per-layout layout list, the same `KeyboardTab` surface will describe
 * action sets (with layers nested) without rippling into `KeyboardHost`.
