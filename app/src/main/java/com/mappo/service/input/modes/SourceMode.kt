/**
 * Runtime handler for a binding_group's [BindingMode] — the foundation laid by Brick 6.1
 * for the per-input-source mode catalog. A [BindingGroup][com.mappo.data.model.steam.BindingGroup]
 * picks one mode; the mode dictates which sub-input keys are valid and what default
 * settings the group should ship with.
 *
 * **What 6.1 implements:** the contract + the two purely-digital modes
 * ([SingleButtonMode], [ButtonPadMode]) that match today's behavior. Their sub-inputs
 * map 1:1 onto physical events the accessibility service already produces, so the
 * compile/dispatch paths don't need to translate anything; the mode object's job is
 * purely to validate the schema and report defaults.
 *
 * **What later bricks add:** richer modes ([BindingMode.TRIGGER]'s click threshold,
 * [BindingMode.SCROLL_WHEEL]'s wheel cadence, [BindingMode.JOYSTICK_MOVE]'s XInput
 * analog passthrough, etc.) extend this same interface with an `evaluate(...)` hook that
 * translates analog source state into per-sub-input events the activator engine consumes.
 * That hook isn't on the interface yet because the digital modes don't need it; it's
 * added when 6.3 (Trigger) brings the first analog mode online.
 *
 * **Forward-compat: [StubMode].** Modes not yet built fall through to a permissive
 * stub (`accepts()` returns true for any sub-input key) so existing seeded data — most
 * of which is in `DPAD`, `LEFT_TRIGGER`, etc. groups — doesn't get dropped by compile
 * validation. Once every mode has a real handler (target: end of Phase 6), the stub
 * goes away and validation becomes globally strict.

 *
 * **Settings (Steam-defaults-tuned for "movement" feel):**
 *  - `dpad_layout` (`"4_way"` / `"8_way"`, default `"4_way"`) — quantization for
 *    analog evaluation. `4_way` picks the dominant axis (|x| vs |y|); only one
 *    direction at a time. `8_way` allows two adjacent directions simultaneously
 *    (a NE push emits `dpad_up` + `dpad_right`). Inert when the mode is
 *    attached to the digital DPAD source — physical `KEYCODE_DPAD_*` always
 *    produces a single direction per press.
 *  - `inner_deadzone` (0..1, default 0.20) — radial deadband for analog
 *    evaluation. Below this magnitude no direction emits. Higher than cursor
 *    modes' 0.10 because a spurious dpad fire is jarring vs. cursor noise
 *    being negligible.
 *  - `outer_deadzone` (0..1, default 0.05) — release-side hysteresis floor for
 *    analog evaluation. Once any direction is latched, the radial magnitude
 *    must drop below `(inner_deadzone - outer_deadzone)` for the directions
 *    to release. Same shape as [TriggerSettings.softHysteresis]; prevents
 *    direction-flutter at the rim of the deadband.
 *
 * **Why DPAD source is skipped in [evaluate].** Controllers vary: some report
 * the physical dpad as `BTN_DPAD_*` key events only, some as `ABS_HAT0X/Y`
 * axis events only, some as both. The accessibility service path through
 * `onKeyEvent` is canonical for the digital DPAD source — it always fires
 * cleanly on devices that report key events. To avoid double-firing
 * `dpad_up` on controllers that report both, [evaluate] short-circuits
 * for [InputSource.DPAD] and lets the digital path own the emit. Revisit if
 * a target device ships HAT-only with no key events for the dpad.
 *
 * **8-way axial threshold.** A diagonal push (e.g. x=0.7, y=-0.7) trivially
 * passes inner_deadzone, so both `dpad_up` and `dpad_right` need to fire.
 * The per-axis floor is the inner_deadzone projected onto the diagonal —
 * `inner_deadzone * sin(45°) ≈ inner_deadzone * 0.707`. With the 0.20
 * default this is ≈0.141, so (0.7, -0.15) emits Up+Right but (0.7, -0.05)
 * emits only Right. Matches typical Steam-Input feel for low-angle pushes.

 *    activator type (FULL_PRESS, LONG_PRESS, DOUBLE_PRESS, RELEASE_PRESS,
 *    CHORDED_PRESS) is valid on this row. Steam-verbatim name; UI label "L2/R2 Full Pull".
 *  - `soft_pull` — the analog soft-pull sub-input. Fires via [evaluate] on
 *    analog readings from the Shizuku motion stream when the magnitude
 *    crosses `soft_threshold` (with `soft_hysteresis` on release). Any
 *    activator type is valid here too — most users pick FULL_PRESS so the
 *    soft pull fires their chosen command once per pull. UI label "L2/R2 Soft Pull".
 *
 * **Why a separate sub-input and not a SOFT_PRESS activator type on `full_pull`?**
 * Steam Input exposes BOTH a SOFT_PRESS activator and a Soft Pull trigger slot,
 * which is the same behavior expressed two ways. Mappo unifies on the sub-input
 * model — one place for the user to express "fire when the trigger is in the
 * soft range" — and retires SOFT_PRESS as a picker option (it stays in the
 * enum solely so VDF import can translate Steam's `SOFT_PRESS` activator into
 * a Mappo activator on the `"soft_pull"` sub-input).
 *
 * **Settings:**
 *  - `click_threshold` — Steam-default 0.95. Documented; inert on Android
 *    today because the hardware decides where the digital click edge sits.
 *  - `soft_threshold` — Steam-default 0.10. Analog magnitude at which a
 *    soft-pull press fires.
 *  - `soft_hysteresis` — Steam-default 0.05. Dead-band width on release;
 *    soft-pull releases when magnitude drops below
 *    `(soft_threshold - soft_hysteresis)`. Prevents wobbly-finger flutter at
 *    the threshold edge.

/**
 * **Flick Stick.** Jibb Smart's invention: the player pushes the stick out to
 * a direction, the camera "flicks" (rotates fast) to face that direction,
 * then while the stick is held the camera rotates 1:1 with the stick's
 * angular delta around its center. Returning the stick to center clears the
 * state; the next push re-flicks to wherever the stick now points.
 *
 * **Output: mouse_dx (horizontal only).** dy is always zero — Flick Stick is
 * a yaw-only camera mode by design.
 *
 * **State machine** per source:
 *  - `NEUTRAL` — stick magnitude < `flick_deadzone`. No output.
 *  - `HOLDING` — stick crossed the activation ring; the flick has been
 *    *committed* and is playing out via the mouse emitter over
 *    `flick_time` ms. Hold-phase angular-delta emissions are LOCKED OUT
 *    during this window so the user's finishing-the-push drift isn't
 *    interpreted as intentional rotation (user-reported bounce-back
 *    artifact 2026-06-03). After the lockout expires, the first evaluate()
 *    re-baselines `lastStickAngleRad` to the current stick angle without
 *    emitting; subsequent evaluates emit hold-phase deltas normally.
 *
 * **Steam parity (verified on Steam Deck by user 2026-06-03):** the flick
 * is committed at threshold-crossing time and plays out over `flick_time`.
 * What the user does *after* crossing — keeps holding at the edge, drifts
 * back into the live zone, releases immediately — doesn't change the flick
 * amount. The flick equals the angle the stick was pointing AT THE INSTANT
 * it crossed the ring.
 *
 * **Coordinate convention.** Screen-up is the zero-angle reference, so a
 * stick push straight up = 0 flick, push right = +π/2 flick (clockwise),
 * push down = ±π (180°), push left = −π/2.
 *
 * **Snap-to-cardinal.** When `flick_snap_mode != 0`, the flick target is
 * snapped to the nearest cardinal (4-way) or 8-way direction with strength
 * proportional to `flick_snap_strength`. 0 = no snap; 1 = full snap. Hold-
 * phase rotation is unaffected — the player can still fine-tune by rotating
 * the stick after the flick.
 *
 * **Source filter.** Stick sources only (LEFT_JOYSTICK / RIGHT_JOYSTICK).
 * GYRO and other sources are no-ops.
 *
 * **Per-source state** lives in [stateBySource]; cleared via [resetState]
 * from [com.mappo.service.input.InputEvaluator.handleConfigChange] on mode
 * change so a deflected stick from the prior mode doesn't leak into the
 * Flick Stick state machine.

 *  - Below the radial deadzone, no ticks fire and the angular baseline resets.
 *  - Above the deadzone, the mode tracks the stick angle. Whenever the angle
 *    advances by [ScrollWheelSettings.scrollAngleDeg] in either direction, one
 *    tick fires on the matching sub-input. The baseline advances by exactly
 *    one threshold per emitted tick so sub-threshold remainder accumulates
 *    cleanly into the next tick.
 *  - Fast rotation that crosses multiple thresholds in a single evaluate
 *    fires multiple ticks back-to-back (e.g. a flicked stick).
 *
 * **Sub-inputs:**
 *  - `scroll_clockwise` — fires one DOWN→UP edge pair per clockwise tick.
 *  - `scroll_counter_clockwise` — same for counter-clockwise.
 *  - `click` / `outer_ring` — passthrough sub-inputs, same as the other
 *    joystick modes; this mode doesn't drive them.
 *
 * The DOWN→UP pair fires in the **same** [evaluate] call, so the activator
 * engine sees one full press cycle per tick (no held-down state across
 * events). A bind to `MOUSE_WHEEL_DOWN` therefore emits exactly one
 * `REL_WHEEL = -1` notch per tick via the existing `dispatchTargetAsClick`
 * → `injectMouseScroll` chain.
 *
 * **Angle convention** (matches [FlickStickMode]): `atan2(x, -y)` so 0 = stick
 * up, +π/2 = right, ±π = down, −π/2 = left. Rotating clockwise from the
 * user's perspective increases the angle, so positive angular delta →
 * `scroll_clockwise` (unless [ScrollWheelSettings.invert] is set).
 *
 * **Source filter.** Joystick sources only (LEFT_JOYSTICK / RIGHT_JOYSTICK).
 * Trackpad rotation would use the same model but Mappo's target hardware
 * lacks capacitive trackpads.
 *
 * **Per-source state** lives in [baselineAngleBySource]; cleared via
 * [resetState] from [com.mappo.service.input.InputEvaluator.handleConfigChange]
 * on mode change so a deflected stick from the prior mode doesn't leak in.

 * (Steam's Mouse Region target use case: aiming in roguelikes / strategy
 * games where the cursor needs to live within a screen sub-region).

 * **Why no integration loop** (unlike [JoystickMouseMode]). Mouse Region is
 * absolute-positioned: when the kernel goes silent at constant stick
 * deflection, the cursor should *stay* at the corresponding region position,
 * not keep moving. So one inject per AnalogEvent is exactly right — no
 * periodic re-application needed. Constant-stick = no events = cursor parked
 * at the right spot. Stick moves again = next event repositions.

/**
 * **Brick D.3 — Gyro → Mouse.** Device rotation rate (rad/sec) → cursor velocity
 * (px/sec) via [MouseEmitter]. Steam's "Gyro to Mouse": yaw rate drives the
 * cursor on screen-X, pitch rate drives screen-Y. Roll (z) is dropped at the
 * evaluator entry point ([InputEvaluator.handleGyroReading]).
 *
 * **Input contract.** [InputEvaluator.handleGyroReading] packs the gyro into
 * an [AnalogEvent] with `source = GYRO`, `x = yaw rad/sec`, `y = pitch rad/sec`.
 * Values are raw angular velocity (not normalized -1..+1 like sticks); this
 * mode reads them as physical rad/sec.
 *
 * **Why velocity, not displacement.** The [MouseEmitter] integration loop is
 * the same machinery [JoystickMouseMode] uses — it re-applies the latest
 * velocity each ~8ms step. For gyro, sensor events arrive at ~50-200 Hz
 * (`SENSOR_DELAY_GAME`), faster than the loop's 8ms cadence, so each event
 * refreshes the velocity before the next step fires. The time-integrated
 * cursor motion equals `∫(yaw_rate × sensitivity) dt = rotation_angle × sensitivity`
 * — which is the physically-correct "pixels per radian of rotation" mapping.
 *
 * **Stops cleanly.** When the user holds the device still, the sensor keeps
 * emitting events near zero. The deadzone filter forces `(vx, vy) = (0, 0)`
 * below threshold, so the [MouseEmitter] slot zeroes out and the integration
 * loop exits — no creeping cursor from sensor noise.
 *
 * **Source filter.** Skips events that aren't `InputSource.GYRO` (defensive —
 * this mode is gyro-source-only in the picker, but a future config edit could
 * route a stick into it via the catalog and we don't want a stick's normalized
 * `(x, y)` interpreted as rad/sec — would result in absurd cursor velocity).
 *
 * Sub-inputs: none. Gyro modes are typically chord-gated via activator layers
 * (a bumper toggles the layer that swaps the gyro source from DEVICE_DEFAULT
 * to GYRO_TO_MOUSE). A future "click" / "gyro_button" sub-input could land
 * here if Mappo grows a built-in gyro-button concept, but Steam doesn't expose
 * one on this mode either.

/**
 * **Brick D.4 — Gyro → Joystick Camera.** Device angular velocity (rad/sec)
 * → virtual right-stick deflection [-1, +1] via the gamepad uinput device.
 * The game reads it as a real Xbox-controller right stick driven by the
 * user tilting the handheld. Canonical "gyro as aim" pattern Steam Deck
 * users prefer over Gyro-to-Mouse for FPS games — the game's stick→camera
 * curve applies its own acceleration / sensitivity, so motion feels native
 * to the title rather than imposed by Mappo.
 *
 * **Why right stick.** FPS / TPS conventions across native gamepad games:
 * right stick = look/camera, left stick = movement. Sending camera input
 * via the right stick lets Wine / GameNative read it as the same axis the
 * game already maps to look.
 *
 * **Rate-based (not angle-integrated).** Like Gyro-to-Mouse: instantaneous
 * angular velocity → instantaneous stick deflection. When the user stops
 * rotating, rate → 0, stick centers, camera stops. This matches Steam
 * Input's "Gyro to Joystick Camera" behavior — the alternative
 * (angle-integrated) is what [GyroToJoystickDeflectionMode] tunes for, but
 * for camera the rate model is the right pick.
 *
 * **Source filter.** Skips events whose `source != GYRO` (defensive — the
 * picker catalog restricts this mode to the gyro source, but a config edit
 * could route a stick reading here). A stick's normalized [-1, +1]
 * interpreted as rad/sec would produce ~negligible deflection through the
 * sensitivity multiplier; the source filter just makes the no-op
 * explicit.

/**
 * **Brick D.4 (refined 2026-06-01) — Gyro → Joystick Deflection.** Device
 * orientation → virtual *left*-stick deflection. The mode treats the device
 * itself like a physical analog stick: tilt the device slightly = stick
 * deflects slightly; tilt significantly = stick deflects fully.
 *
 * **Tilt-based, not rate-based.** Reads absolute device orientation
 * (`reading.tiltRollRad` / `reading.tiltPitchRad`, sourced from
 * `TYPE_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR` via [GyroSensorStream]) and subtracts a
 * captured reference. Tilt-from-reference angle → stick deflection
 * magnitude. Holding the device tilted at 30° gives a sustained stick
 * deflection, unlike rate-based modes where holding still = no input.
 * Critically also doesn't accumulate noise (the rotation-vector sensor is
 * already gyro+accel fused and drift-free), so a stationary device
 * produces a stationary stick.
 *
 * **Auto-calibration.** Reference orientation captured on the first event
 * after [resetState] — i.e. at gyro-pipeline activation. The user's
 * natural holding angle becomes "neutral." Reset across layout / set
 * boundaries via [InputEvaluator.flushAnalog].
 *
 * **Output mapping** lives in [GyroJoystickDeflectionSettings]: the
 * tilt-from-reference angle maps through a deflection-angle window
 * (default 2°–45°) to a joystick-output window with a power curve.
 *
 * **Companion to Camera, but different primitive.** Camera stays rate-based
 * because FPS aim feels right as "rotate-to-look-around"; Deflection is
 * tilt-based because movement feels right as "lean-to-walk." Both still
 * route through the per-source gamepad cache so physical sticks can
 * contribute alongside gyro additively.
 *
 * Same defensive source filter as the camera variant — see the KDoc on
 * [GyroToJoystickCameraMode].

/**
 * **Brick D.5 — Gyro → Directional Swipe.** Rate-based one-shot gesture
 * mode that emits a directional sub-input edge when the device is rotated
 * past a per-axis threshold. Steam Deck's modern replacement for legacy
 * gyro Flick Stick.
 *
 * **Behavior** (verified against Steam Deck 2026-05-31):
 *  - Rotating the device forward / back (pitch) fires `dpad_up` / `dpad_down`.
 *  - Yawing the device left / right (rotation around the vertical axis,
 *    like turning a steering wheel) fires `dpad_left` / `dpad_right`.
 *  - Each sub-input fires DOWN when the corresponding rate exceeds
 *    `rate_threshold`; releases UP when the rate drops below
 *    `release_floor`. Typical use: brief flick → quick down+up pair → the
 *    downstream activator engine sees it as a Regular Press (tap).
 *  - Hysteresis (threshold ≫ release_floor) prevents direction flutter
 *    during the deceleration phase of a flick.
 *
 * **Why rate-based, not angle-integrated.** The user's description was
 * specifically "triggered when the user gyros the device" — the rotation
 * gesture itself fires the command. Holding the device tilted doesn't
 * keep firing; that's [GyroToJoystickDeflectionMode]'s lane. Per-axis
 * thresholding without angle integration matches the test feel.
 *
 * **Axis mapping.**
 *  - `reading.y` is pitch rate (sign-corrected by [InputEvaluator.handleGyroReading]
 *    so pitching forward gives y < 0).
 *  - `reading.z` is yaw rate (rotation around screen-normal axis).
 *
 * **Source filter** identical to the other gyro modes. Non-GYRO sources
 * could in principle host this mode (joystick-flick gestures), but Steam
 * exposes Directional Swipe only on the gyro source, so we mirror that.
 *
 * **Stateless** — no per-source integrator state. The previous-emit state
 * lives in [ModeContext.priorLatched], same idiom as [DpadMode].

 * knobs behave identically across the digital Button-Pad/D-Pad → joystick path
 * and this analog path. Keys mirror
 * [com.mappo.ui.screen.remap.settings.SourceModeSettingsSchema]'s

 *
 * [toShaped] outputs a deadzone- and curve-shaped `(x, y)` in the raw **+Y-down**
 * convention (no scale/invert/rotate yet); the caller hands it to
 * [JoystickOutputSettings.apply] for the rest. Tolerant of missing keys.
 *
 * **Shaping pipeline** (each setting independently observable when tested):
 *  1. Deadzone by [deadzoneShape] → dead band rescaled out so a stick just past
 *     the inner edge produces non-zero output.
 *  2. Response curve by [responseAxisStyle] (per-axis vs. circular distance).
 *
 * Units as stored by the schema's sliders: deadzone handles are percentages
 * (0..100); [commandRadius] is the raw Steam 0..32767 radius. Normalized at
 * parse time.
 *
 * [hapticIntensity] + the outer-ring fields are consumed by [StickOuterRingHaptics]
 * (the outer-ring command edge + the movement-driven joystick haptic), shared
 * with Joystick Mouse. [parse] takes per-mode defaults for the response curve +
 * axis style because Joystick Mouse defaults them differently (Wide / Per axis)

 *
 * **What's in:** the analog stick / mouse / scroll modes whose `evaluate()`
 * hook needs a motion stream, plus [BindingMode.TRIGGER] (added in Brick 5
 * for Soft_Press — the soft threshold can only be detected from the analog
 * pull magnitude, not the hardware click edge), plus [BindingMode.DPAD]

 * (x, y) into synthetic N/S/E/W edges; the physical DPAD source skips the
 * analog path and uses `KEYCODE_DPAD_*` through the accessibility service).
 * **What's out:** purely-digital modes (SINGLE_BUTTON, BUTTON_PAD, REFERENCE,
 * UNBOUND) and RADIAL_MENU / TOUCH_MENU (open question, parked digital for now).
 *
 * **Refinement note.** Adding TRIGGER and DPAD unconditionally is correct
 * but loose: a binding_group in TRIGGER mode with only a FULL_PRESS
 * activator (no SOFT_PRESS) doesn't actually need motion capture; a
 * binding_group in DPAD mode attached to the physical DPAD source doesn't
 * either. A future refinement could tighten the predicate by inspecting the
