/**
 * Runtime state machine that turns physical input events into [BindingOutput] emissions.
 *
 * Event-driven: every call corresponds to a discrete `onKeyEvent` (Phase 2.2) or
 * normalized analog edge (Phase 6, deferred); no polling, no per-frame tick. The
 * accessibility service hands events here, the evaluator decides what to fire,
 * [OutputEmitter] does the actual injection.
 *
 * Activator coverage:
 *  - **Brick 2.2** — `FULL_PRESS` (DOWN emits, UP releases).
 *  - **Brick 3.1** — `LONG_PRESS` / `START_PRESS` / `RELEASE_PRESS` with timing.
 *  - **Brick 3.2** — `DOUBLE_PRESS` window state machine + Regular/Double coexistence.
 *  - **Brick 3.3** — Universal settings (toggle, hold-to-repeat / turbo, fire start/end
 *    delays, cycle bindings, interruptable) and `CHORDED_PRESS`.
 *  - **Brick 5.1** — Action-set layer stack with `add_layer` / `remove_layer` /
 *    `hold_layer` verbs. Top-of-stack wins on lookup; `CHANGE_PRESET` clears the stack.
 *
 * State held here:
 *  - [held] — per-address held entries released on UP. Each entry captures the bindings,
 *    the activator they came from, and any `fire_end_delay` set on that activator (snapshot
 *    so a config swap between press and release doesn't change the release semantics).
 *  - [pending] — coroutine [Job]s scheduled for the *primary* timer of a temporal
 *    activator (`LONG_PRESS` threshold, etc.).
 *  - [doubleTapWindows] — per-address state for in-flight DOUBLE_PRESS detection.
 *  - [activatorState] — per-activator runtime state that outlives a single event: toggle
 *    latch, hold-to-repeat job, fire-start-delay job, cycle index. Keyed by activatorId
 *    rather than address so two inputs sharing one activator (Phase 6 reference groups)
 *    would correctly share state. Today every activator is reachable from exactly one
 *    address, so the keying choice is forward-compat rather than load-bearing.
 *
 * Config-change semantics: if the compiled config changes while a binding is held, the
 * original binding's release still fires because [held] is a snapshot of what was
 * emitted at press time — we do *not* re-resolve on release. Toggle latches survive a
 * config swap; pressing the activator again toggles off normally.

     *  - `AnalogEvent.x` ← `+GyroEvent.xRadPerSec` — rolling the device
     *    (one side dipping) drives cursor horizontal motion.
     *  - `AnalogEvent.y` ← `−GyroEvent.yRadPerSec` — pitching the device
     *    (top edge toward/away) drives cursor vertical motion. Sign
     *    inverted so pitching the device's top edge AWAY moves the cursor
     *    UP (matches natural "aim where you're pointing" feel).
     *  - `zRadPerSec` is dropped. Add a parallel entry point if a future
     *    mode needs it.
     *
     * **Why not Android's "X = pitch, Y = yaw"?** That convention applies to
     * portrait-natural devices. Mappo's targets (AYN Thor / Odin 2 Mini /
     * Anbernic / Retroid) are landscape-natural handhelds — the sensor's X
     * axis runs along the device's long horizontal edge in landscape, so
     * rotation around X reads as roll, not pitch. The pre-2026-05-31 code
     * assumed portrait convention and felt 90°-off on every Mappo target.
     *
     * Per-mode `invert_x` / `invert_y` settings handle user-preference sign
     * flips on top of this base mapping. Generic-Android calibration support
     * (e.g. devices with non-standard sensor frames) is deferred until a
     * device-spread test reveals one.
     *
     * **Values are rad/s, not [-1, 1].** Stick `AnalogEvent` readings are
     * normalized; gyro readings are raw angular velocity. Mode handlers
